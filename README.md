Remote sensing in the Gulf of Guinea project

This folder contains the relevant Python code (.ipynb files) and example data (.nc files)
for the "Remote sensing in the Gulf of Guinea" project.

This folder contains two choices:
1. local -- Notebooks assuming the student is running the code locally
2. GoogleColab -- Notebooks assuming the student is running the code on Google Colab Notebooks.

The data come from Remote Sensing Systems (remss.com) and consist of sea surface salinity.
If time permits, the students will explore use of sea surface temperature, as well,
but this will be a challenge problem (extra), not required of the student.

The main code is in the Python3 programming language together with Jupyter notebooks.
