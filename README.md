# remote-sensing-gog
Remote sensing in the Gulf of Guinea project

The purpose of this file is to describe the code for the GoG project.
The students will use Google Colab to read in some data in the GoG.
The dataset will come from Remote Sensing Systems (remss.com) and will
consist of sea surface salinity. If time permits, the students can explore
use of sea surface temperature data, as well.

The main code is archived in Jupyter notebooks and will make use of Python3.
