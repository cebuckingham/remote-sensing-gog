Remote sensing in the Gulf of Guinea project

This folder contains the relevant Python code (.ipynb files) and example data (.nc files)
for the "Remote sensing in the Gulf of Guinea" project.

The data come from Remote Sensing Systems (remss.com) and consist of sea surface salinity.
If time permits, the student can explore use of sea surface temperature measurements, as well,
but this will be a challenge problem, not one that we will cover as a class.

The main code is archived in the form of Jupyter notebooks and will make use of the Python3 programming language.
